# demostatistics-generator
Generates some statistics for CS:GO demos. 

This project was mainly made as an example for [demoinfo-public](https://github.com/moritzuehling/demoinfo-public). If you want to want an entry-code how demoinfo-public should be used, look at [the `Main()`-method](https://github.com/moritzuehling/demostatistics-generator/blob/master/StatisticsGenerator/Program.cs). 

I tried to document everything. If you have useage-questions you can post them here as an issue!
